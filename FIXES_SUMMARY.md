## ‚úÖ Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Added Missing Theme CSS Definitions

**File:** `src/app/globals.css`

**Changes:**
- Added `.theme-corporate` - Corporate Blue theme with professional blue color palette
- Added `.theme-modern` - Modern Teal theme with fresh teal/cyan colors  
- Added `.theme-vibrant` - Vibrant Orange theme with energetic orange colors
- Added `.theme-professional` - Professional Navy theme with trustworthy navy colors

**Total CSS Variables per Theme:** ~40 variables including:
- Primary, secondary, background, foreground
- Card, popover, muted, accent colors
- Destructive, success, warning, info states
- Border, input, ring styles
- Chart colors (1-5)
- Sidebar colors and variants

**Lines Added:** ~150 lines of new CSS

### Fix 2: Updated CustomThemeProvider

**File:** `src/components/CustomThemeProvider.tsx`

**Changes:**

1. **Added Complete Theme Class List:**
   ```typescript
   const ALL_THEME_CLASSES = [
     'theme-light', 'theme-dark', 'theme-ocean', 
     'theme-twilight', 'theme-slate', 'theme-blue', 
     'theme-purple', 'theme-corporate', 'theme-modern', 
     'theme-vibrant', 'theme-professional'
   ]
   ```

2. **Improved Theme Cleanup:**
   - Now removes all theme classes before applying new one
   - Uses spread operator for cleaner code
   - Ensures no leftover theme classes

3. **Added Dynamic CSS Injection:**
   - New `applyDynamicTheme()` function
   - Reads theme config from database
   - Applies custom colors as CSS variables directly to `:root`
   - Allows for on-the-fly theme customization without page refresh

4. **Added Theme Removal Helper:**
   - New `removeDynamicTheme()` function
   - Cleans up custom CSS variables when theme is deactivated
   - Prevents theme pollution

5. **Enhanced Logging:**
   - Added console logs for debugging
   - `[Theme] Applied theme: [name]` on successful application
   - `[Theme] No active theme, using system default` when no theme set
   - Warnings for invalid theme configs

**Benefits:**
- Themes now apply immediately across the entire site
- Custom color modifications persist correctly
- Better debugging with console logs
- Cleaner code with helper functions

### Fix 3: Fixed Pages API Response Format

**File:** `src/app/api/pages/route.ts`

**Change:**
```typescript
// Before:
return NextResponse.json(pages)

// After:
return NextResponse.json({ pages })
```

**Why:** The frontend expects `{ pages: [...] }` but API was returning `[...]` directly.
